The standard way of running the LandscapeRGolem app is to simply load the LandscapeRGolem library and call the `run_app` function:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(LandscapeRGolem)

run_app()
```

This will load the app with whatever data sits inside the LandscapeRGolem on your computer's `app_server.R` file. To run the app with custom data, you can use the `run_app_from_other_project` function, and use the `data =` argument to feed in your data.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data <- readr::read_csv(path/to/data)

run_app_from_other_project(data = data)
```

However, both of these methods will run the app using your current R session, meaning you can't do anything else in R without closing the application. Wouldn't it be **great** if we could run the app and keep our R console free to do other things?

WELL YOU CAN!

# Running in a Separate Process

There are two main methods, one involves using the terminal, and the other involves the {processx} R package. If using the terminal isn't too daunting a prospect, I recommend that approach.

To use both steps, you need to save an Rscript (.R file) which gives the instructions of how to run the app. 

First we need to load our libraries and set the port for our shiny app, it's important that no other process is using this port. 

Second we need to make sure that our data has the columns the app requires, which are: document, date, text, clean_text, cluster, V1, V2, permalink. So we define a function that will do this for us.

Third we get some data and run it through our `prepare_data_for_landscaper` function. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(LandscapeRGolem)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
options(shiny.port = 3838)

prepare_data_for_landscaper <- function(data, document_var, date_var, text_var, clean_text_var, colour_var, x_var, y_var,permalink_var){
  data <- data %>%
    dplyr::rename(document = {{document_var}},
                  date = {{date_var}},
                  text = {{text_var}},
                  clean_text = {{clean_text_var}},
                  cluster = {{colour_var}},
                  V1 = {{x_var}},
                  V2 = {{y_var}},
                  permalink = {{permalink_var}})
  return(data)
}

data <- read_csv(path/to/data)

data <- prepare_data_for_landscaper(data, document, date, text, clean_text, cluster_name, V1, V2, permalink)

LandscapeRGolem::run_app_from_other_project(data = data)
```

We then need to save this script in a file. I recommend saving this in your current Rstudio project, particularly if you do not feel confident navigating your file system via file paths. Let's say you save it as 'run_app_locally.R', and the project you are working in is called my_project, which is located in a folder called 'projects' which can be found in your home directory. 

From your project's working directory, the path to this file would be run_app_locally.R, that's it!

## Processx

From your Rstudio project, provided you have a saved file named 'run_app_locally.R' containing the code above, with your data correctly entered, you will be able to access the app like so:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(processx)
r_process <- process$new("Rscript", "run_app_locally.R")
r_process #Check it says running, not finished
```

Then type localhost:3838 into your browser, you should find LandscapeRGolem running. To kill the app:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
r_process$kill()
r_process #should be finished now, not running.
```


## Terminal

From the terminal, the path to this file would be ~/projects/my_project/run_app_locally.R

Open a terminal and execute
`Rscript ~~/projects/my_project/run_app_locally.R`

You should see
'Listening on http://127.0.0.1:3838' this means you can copy that http url, or type 'localhost:3838' into your browser to open the app. Your R console will remain free. Remember to close the app when you are done by entering the terminal and (on a Mac) typing 'control + c' then hitting enter.   

You should see 'Execution halted'.
